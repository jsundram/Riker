Riker is an mp3 tagger that uses The Echo Nest's Musical Finger Prints (ENMFP):

You need to have installed the ENMFP before this will work:
please email enmfp@echonest.com for access to the binaries.
(Response is usually very fast).

Riker uses the ENMFP to find metadata for your mp3 files, and updates them with metadata.

Data sources:
    Genre, artist, and title come from the Echo Nest
    Lyrics come from musixmatch (when available)
    Album art comes from 7digital, via the Echo Nest API.

Usage:

python riker.py [file or folder]

The command line argument, if specified, is a file to update, or a folder full of .mp3 files, each of which will be updated. If no argument is specified, the current directory will be used.

The default behavior is to update the ID3 tags if they exist, but never to overwrite existing data.
